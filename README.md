# <a href = 'https://github.com/KennethECochran/projects/tree/main/Environmental%20Health%20project%20-%20part%201'>Environmental Health project - part 1</a>
<p>This project uses python to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean the PFAS_J file for analysis</li>
  <li>Calculating the pearson-correlation coefficient and creating a distance table, filtering the data for values over 0.50, and  creating a heatmap showing relation</li>
  <li>Extracting linear relationships between data by calculating P-value of the F statistic and R^2 value</li>
</ul>

# <a href = 'https://github.com/KennethECochran/projects/tree/main/Environmental%20Health%20Project%20-%20Part%202'>Environmental Health project - Part 2</a>
<p>This project uses python to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean each dataset</li>
  <li>Calculate the pearson correlation coefficient</li>
  <li>Calculate the p-values of the F statistic and R^2 values between each pair of variables</li>
  <li>Exports final filtered matrix to a csv file</li>
</ul>

# <a href = 'https://github.com/KennethECochran/projects/tree/main/KNN_decision_tree'>KNN_decision_tree</a>
<p>KNN uses python to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applies K-Nearest Neighbor classification to the Iris dataset using petal length and petal width</li>
  <li>Splits the data into testing and training data</li>
  <li>Compares predicted values to true values</li>
  <li>Graphs correct predictions and incorrect predictions based on flower classification</li>
</ul>
<p>decision_tree uses python to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applies the SkLearn decision tree classifier to the Iris dataset</li>
  <li>Loads the Iris dataset and splits data into testing and training</li>
  <li>Loops through the data ten times and fits the decision tree to the training data</li>
  <li>Uses the accuracy score metric to compare the test classification to the predicted classification</li>
  <li>Obtained a mean prediction accuracy of 95%</li>
</ul>
